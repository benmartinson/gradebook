# Work in Progress

#### Description
I've started this 'Gradebook' project as a way to keep my skills up and try out a new database tool called [Convex](https://docs.convex.dev/home), which intrigued me. I created a similar gradebook for my previous employer [(link)](https://community.veracross.com/s/article/Markbook-Overview), so this is also a way to test myself to create a similar thing in a different way, although with way less features. I just started recently so there's still a lot to work out.

#### Initial design:

### Run locally
```
npm install
```
then run front end server:
```
npm run dev:frontend
```
and backend on a different terminal tab:
```
npm run dev:backend
```
